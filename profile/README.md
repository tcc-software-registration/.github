# Software Registration 

This organization aims to guide the software registration process that is developed in course completion work.

Initially, the student must contact their advisor to check the feasibility of registering the software.

For this registration to be carried out in partnership with the Federal Institute of Para√≠ba, some documents must be completed and institutional requirements met.


## Required artifacts

* Fork the project to this organization (contact an administrator for this organization).

* In your software repository, create a README.md with basic guidance on the project and the steps for its execution. Remember to include a short section describing all collaborators.

* Provide a short video describing the software (it could be the video presented in the TCC) and add the link in the README of your repository.

* Fill out the [form](https://github.com/tcc-software-registration/.github/blob/main/profile/form-software-registration.docx) (contact your advisor).

* Send the completed form to the advisor so that the process can be opened.
