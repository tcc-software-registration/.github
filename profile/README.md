# Software Registration 

This organization aims to guide the software registration process that is developed in course completion work.

Initially, the student must contact their advisor to check the feasibility of registering the software.

For this registration to be carried out in partnership with the Federal Institute of Para√≠ba, some documents must be completed and institutional requirements met.
